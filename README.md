NOTE: Microsoft Access database file (appointments.accdb) is not included due to lack of access to the paid software.
The table structure is defined and ready for integration:
  - Table Name: Appointments
    - ID (AutoNumber, Primary Key)
    - Name (Short Text)
    - Date (Date/Time)
    - Time (Short Text)
    - Reason (Short Text)

The ASP code is fully functional and will work once the .accdb file is added.
